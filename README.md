- 👋 Hi, I’m @Curriemonster (Andi Currie)
- 👀 I’m interested in outside of wanting to learn how to code and build my own projects, I love history and Metal detecting
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5 and CSS basics, alongside Autocad for a project that I have undertaken during lockdown
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me with understand ways of coding that will be beneficial to adding to my portfolio with the intention of getting a job in a junior developer role
- 📫 How to reach me.. On here for now, until I have a redirect to show you...
